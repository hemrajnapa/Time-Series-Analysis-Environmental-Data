# Time Series Analysis of Environmental Data

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing time series data related to various environmental factors such as rainfall, groundwater depth, temperature, and hydrometry. The analysis includes data preprocessing, checking for stationarity, and forecasting future values using the ARIMA model. By analyzing historical patterns in the data, we can make informed predictions about future environmental conditions.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To clean and preprocess environmental data, making it suitable for time series analysis.
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key trends in the data.
To check the stationarity of the time series data using statistical tests.
To build and train ARIMA models for forecasting future values of key variables.
To evaluate model performance using error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
