# Time Series Analysis of Environmental Data

1. Overview:
    This project focuses on analyzing time series data related to various environmental factors such as rainfall, groundwater depth, temperature, and hydrometry. The analysis includes data preprocessing, checking for stationarity, and forecasting future values using the ARIMA model. By analyzing historical patterns in the data, we can make informed predictions about future environmental conditions.

2. Objectives
    1. To clean and preprocess environmental data, making it suitable for time series analysis.
    2. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key trends in the data.
    3. To check the stationarity of the time series data using statistical tests.
    4. To build and train ARIMA models for forecasting future values of key variables.
    5. To evaluate model performance using error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

3. What is Time Series Forecasting?
     Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed values. This is especially useful for data that changes over time, such as environmental data, stock prices, or weather. One popular model for time series forecasting is ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which models the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.

4. Analysis Performed
    1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and patterns in the data over time.
    2. Stationarity Tests: Checking if the time series is stationary using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. A stationary series has a constant mean and variance over time, which is a requirement for many forecasting models.
    3. ARIMA Modeling: Building ARIMA models to predict future values. ARIMA incorporates three key components:
       1. AutoRegression (AR): The relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
       2. Integrated (I): Differencing of observations to make the series stationary.
       3. Moving Average (MA): The relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model.
